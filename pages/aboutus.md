Hi everyone!
CIVICA Echoes stems from the desire of a group of students from Bocconi University and Sciences Po to generate a real impact, helping women around the world and raising awareness on the female experience. We are students of Economics International Organizations Management, Political Science, and Social Sciences, brought together by the need to contribute to a greater good.
