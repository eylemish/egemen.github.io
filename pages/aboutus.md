# # Who are we?

CIVICA Echoes stems from the desire of a group of students from Bocconi University and Sciences Po to generate a real impact, helping women around the world and raising awareness on the female experience. We are students of Economics, International Organizations Management, Political Science, and Social Sciences, brought together by the need to contribute to a greater good. 

Funded by CIVICA’s brand-new Student Engagement Fund, our project is dedicated to spotlighting the daily reality of women around the world, by sharing their stories and amplifying their voices. We envision the CIVICA Echoes website as a one-stop hub dedicated to valuable resources and informative material, all in the same easily accessible place.  The content published will hopefully foster a strong community, make everyone feel heard, promote empathy, and raise awareness. Together, we can work towards a shared sense of responsibility, building a world where everyone feels safe. 

# # What is CIVICA?
