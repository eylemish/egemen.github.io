CIVICA Echoes is a student-led initiative by Bocconi and Sciences Po students, in collaboration with Mass Media and Culture and Sundial Press. Given the complexity and global relevance of the issues we explore, we welcome contributions from the public, particularly from young voices in Milan and Reims.

## What is Mass Media and Culture?

<a href="https://massmediandculture.com/">Mass Media & Culture</a> is a student-run association located within Bocconi University. We offer a dedicated team of students providing columns, editorials, articles, graphics, and other quality content. Content made to inform and inspire readers and viewers alike.

Launched in December 2020, members of MMC found that there was no association for students to delve and voice their opinions on topics such as Art, Media, and Culture and how they are interconnected to our way of life and society. And hence began the process of forming the MMC that we know of today. 

## What is Sundial Press?

<a href="https://www.sundialpress.co/">The Sundial Press</a> is the student-directed media outlet of Sciences Po Campus of Reims. It publishes editions in print and online. Originally started as a group project when the campus of Reims was founded in 2011, it has become a newspaper covering all aspects of student life at Sciences Po and in Reims as well as the global issues that impact the universityâ€™s international student body.
