Letter from the Board, 

Women’s struggles transcend time. Men come and go, yet the challenges women face persist—sometimes evolving, sometimes unchanged. CIVICA Echoes is a student-led initiative bringing together voices from diverse backgrounds to shed light on the issues confronting women across the globe today. Our project was born from a shared conviction: that journalism, storytelling, and research are powerful forces for change. In an era of fleeting attention spans and deepening polarization, we stand for informed dialogue, in-depth analysis, and cross-border solidarity.

Our focus is on a theme that goes beyond borders yet remains deeply personal—women’s rights and the ongoing femicide crisis. This crisis takes different shapes across the world: from abortion rights in the U.S. to the legal reckoning sparked by Gisele Pelicot’s bravery in France, from Turkey’s withdrawal from the Istanbul Convention to the struggles of women in conflict zones. Each story reignites the debate on women’s rights, forcing societies to confront uncomfortable truths. Too often, governments dismiss systemic injustices, and institutions fail in their duty to protect. But silence is not an option.

Through CIVICA Echoes, we aim to amplify the voices of those affected, analyze the policies shaping our reality, and explore the broader societal structures that allow such injustices to persist. This initiative is more than a platform—it is a call to action. It is an opportunity for young minds to contribute to the conversation, to challenge narratives, and to foster solutions rooted in solidarity and awareness.

Our doors are open to contributions from students, journalists, activists, and thinkers who share our commitment. Whether through investigative reports, opinion pieces, or artistic expressions, we seek to create a space where stories matter, perspectives are heard, and change begins with awareness.

Join us in echoing the voices that refuse to be silenced.

In solidarity,
The CIVICA Echoes Team
