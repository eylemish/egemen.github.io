Feminism is about dismantling the patriarchy to liberate both men and women from socially
constructed gender stereotypes. It is to break down limitations imposed on us all since the
day we are born.  

Feminism aims to benefit us all, yet there is a concerning wave of doubt in it. Especially in
recent years, Gen-Z started to show growing patterns of anti-feminist sentiment. A study by
Ipsos shows that 60 percent of young men across 31 countries think women’s equality is
discriminating against men.

From personal experience, my observation has been that many of my male peers (more
than females) would hesitate to align themselves with feminism. Some even distance
themselves from feminism despite standing up for gender equality.  

I believe this reflects a broader ideological gap that is widening between young men and
women regarding political and social matters. Gen-Z is challenging the assumption that each
generation is socially more progressive than the last and statistics show that the gap
between young women and men is widening in terms of support for progressive values. This
phenomenon is observed through voting habits in politics as well. Recent elections from all
around the world demonstrate that the rising far right gets a strikingly higher level of vote
from men among young voters.  

This overall ideological shift to the far-right prevails also in terms of gender related topics
and feminism. We interviewed some Bocconi students about their views on gender equality
and feminism and if they would call themselves a feminist. Some answers were striking:

‘I stand for gender equality but also for meritocracy, so I am not a feminist.
’

‘Gender equality is important but feminism has gone too far.
’

‘Yes I am a feminist but I am not a radical feminist, we should not kill all men.
’

Feminism is increasingly seen as an ‘extreme’ ideology that shifts the power balance
favoring women over men and is viewed differently from gender equality. To some, patriarchy
does not exist anymore so feminism is not needed.

To understand this backlash, I have been asking questions to myself, academics and peers:
Can we communicate feminism in a better way? What is the effect of the media, which also
has become a playground for anti-feminists like Andrew Tate who would not hesitate to make
money and gain popularity by polarising people? When I first decided to write this article, I
was going to discuss these factors but rather than throwing out a bunch of statistics, I will try
to give a better idea of feminism and hope that we, the young people, can thrive to
understand and not turn our back to it.

Of course feminism was born out of the struggle of women, to be the voice of a subjugated
group, power them and achieve equality. However, equality in feminism never meant to
reverse the power balance between women and men and give more favor to women. When
we, feminists, want to dismantle patriarchy, it is to construct a society where we can all thrive together. It is to reject the same patriarchal system that still creates the gender pay gap and puts overwhelming expectations on men to be the financial provider. It is about breaking down the same norms that view women as ‘fragile and weak’ and creates a mental health epidemic among men because they have to be ‘emotionally tough’. By breaking down
patriarchy, feminism seeks a world where gender roles no longer dictate anyone's
opportunities, freedoms or worth.

Yes, patriarchy is still alive! And it will stay alive as long as femicides continue,
as long as men feel ‘less of a man’ when they stay home and raise children while their wives
work,

as long as rape survivors are asked what they were wearing,

as long as men are ashamed of talking about feelings,

as long as sexism is ignored because it's ‘just a joke’.

Anybody who believes in equality is a feminist. You do not necessarily have to be a protest
organizing activist to call yourself one.

As Gen-Z and the younger generations to come, I believe we have the curiosity and the tools
to look beyond echo chambers in social media and understand the true values of the
feminist movement and what it aims to achieve. We are not going to be divided by those in
leadership positions who fail to provide enough employment and economic welfare for the
people and decide to blame gender quotas for instance. We are definitely smart enough to
understand that equality should not feel like a loss for the previously advantaged group, but
it should be to be seen as an opportunity to be a part of change, a movement of social
justice and a society where issues are recognized and solved.

We must seek out the truth, understand the core principles of feminism, engage in critical
discussions and commit to improving it, together!
